#### HVaR_Auto_Backtesting
##### 1. Purpose:
As the yield curve and banking book changes daily but value at risk modelling methodology stays the same. Therefore, automating the HVaR and backtesting process is highly in demand and regarded. 
##### 2. Major Steps
         2.1 Upload the historical market yield
         2.2 Bootstrapping the yield curve
         2.3 Calcuate daily market yield changes
         2.4 Determine portfolio market values changes
         2.5 Determine dynamic HVaR and its variations (ES with different horizon and confidence level)
         2.6 Determine if HVaR passes the Backtesting (Always based on yesterday's portfolio)
         2.7 Job scheduling and email notifications.
